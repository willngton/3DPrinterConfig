# This file contains common pin mappings for MKS Robin Nano (v1.2.004)
# boards. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32F103. When running "make menuconfig", enable "extra low-level
# configuration setup", select the 28KiB bootloader, and serial (on
# USART3 PB11/PB10) communication.

# Note that the "make flash" command does not work with MKS Robin
# boards. After running "make", run the following command:
#   ./scripts/update_mks_robin.py out/klipper.bin out/Robin_nano.bin
# Copy the file out/Robin_nano.bin to an SD card and then restart the
# printer with that SD card.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
